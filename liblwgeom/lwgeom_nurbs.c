/**
 * Construct a new NURBS curve.
 *
 * Creates a NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline) curve object from the
 * provided control points, optional weights, and optional knot vector.
 *
 * Validation and ownership:
 * - Returns NULL if degree is outside [1,10].
 * - If `weights` is non-NULL, `nweights` must equal the number of control points.
 * - If `knots` is non-NULL, `nknots` must equal npoints + degree + 1.
 * - Ownership of `points` is transferred to the returned curve (caller must not free it).
 * - `weights` and `knots`, if provided, are deep-copied into the new curve.
 *
 * Behavioral notes:
 * - If `weights` is NULL, the curve is treated as non-rational (implicit weights = 1.0).
 * - If `knots` is NULL, a uniform clamped knot vector will be generated on demand.
 *
 * @param srid Spatial reference identifier for the curve.
 * @param degree Polynomial degree of the curve (1..10).
 * @param points Control points array; ownership is transferred to the returned curve.
 * @param weights Optional weights array; copied when non-NULL.
 * @param knots Optional knot vector; copied when non-NULL.
 * @param nweights Number of entries in `weights` (must match point count if `weights` provided).
 * @param nknots Number of entries in `knots` (must equal npoints + degree + 1 if `knots` provided).
 * @return Pointer to the newly allocated LWNURBSCURVE, or NULL on invalid parameters.
